/**
 * Delivery, from the three sides that touch one (MART_INTEGRATION.md §3.1, §4).
 *
 * ONE ROUTER, THREE AUDIENCES, and each action names who may take it:
 *
 *   THE STORE accepts or refuses the order and says when it is packed. This is
 *   its own decision and nobody else's - PartTime holds no stock data, so the
 *   shop's answer is the only availability signal that exists.
 *
 *   THE COURIER, meaning the one person holding the contract on the posting,
 *   marks collection, completes against the customer's code, and reports a
 *   failed attempt. Not "any courier": the guard is the contract, because a
 *   worker who can name an id must not be able to mark somebody else's job
 *   collected.
 *
 *   AFRIZONE STAFF read every order and can cancel one, and can act for a store
 *   that answered by telephone. That last one is not a back door, it is the
 *   normal case for a shop that does not use the portal - and it is audited as
 *   having been done by staff, not by the store.
 *
 * THE CUSTOMER'S DETAILS ARE NOT ON THE POSTING. They are returned only to the
 * courier who holds the job and to staff. §5 lets PartTime hold a display name,
 * a number, a door and an instruction, for as long as it takes to deliver one
 * order - and a public task list is not that.
