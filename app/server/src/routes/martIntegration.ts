/**
 * The inbound edge of the AfriZoneMart integration (Blueprint §5, §13).

 * ONE ENDPOINT, NOT FOUR. Mart emits an event bus, so PartTime subscribes to a
 * bus: one signature scheme, one idempotency mechanism, one retry story. Four
 * endpoints would mean four of each and three chances to get one wrong.
 *
 * This route is NOT behind requireAuth. It is authenticated by an HMAC over the
 * raw body, the way the Paystack and Smile webhooks already are - Mart is a
 * system, not a user, and giving it a session token would mean a credential that
 * can do everything a person can.
