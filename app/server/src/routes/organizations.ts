/**
 * Organizations: the businesses a person may act for, and the ones Afrizone
 * administers. A store and a courier company are the same shape here - what
 * differs is the work they receive, not who they are.
 *
 * WHY THESE ROUTES DO NOT USE requireAccountType, WHICH WILL LOOK LIKE AN
 * OVERSIGHT:
 *
 *   Membership is the authority here, not account type. `User.accountType`
 *   records how someone primarily uses the platform and decides which dashboard
 *   they land on; it is not a claim about which businesses they may touch, and
 *   every STORE account gives the same answer to it. Gating on it as well would
 *   buy nothing and would break a real case - an individual worker who also
 *   helps at their family's shop is one person with one login, an INDIVIDUAL
 *   account type, and a legitimate OrganizationMember row.
 *
 *   So requireAccountType is for gating features that belong to a KIND of
 *   account (courier-only, individual-only). Anything scoped to a particular
 *   business asks util/organization.ts instead, which answers the question that
 *   actually matters: may this person touch THIS organization.
 *
 * Two routers, mounted separately: the default one is for a business's own
 * people, `adminRouter` is for Afrizone staff. Splitting them keeps the approval
 * and suspension endpoints away from any path a member can reach, rather than
 * relying on a role check buried in a shared handler.
