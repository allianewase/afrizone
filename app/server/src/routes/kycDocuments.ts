// not a WHATWG WritableStream - `file.body.pipeTo(res)` doesn't throw, it
// just hangs forever (Node streams don't implement the Web Streams sink
// interface `pipeTo` writes to), until Workers' own hang-detection kills the
// request. Returning a raw `Response(file.body, ...)` from the top-level
// fetch handler sidesteps the Node/Web stream boundary entirely.

// POST /api/me/kyc/documents is handled OUTSIDE this Express router entirely
// (see handleKycUpload below + index.ts) - Workers' Request.formData() is
// used instead of multer, since multer's multipart parsing depends on
// Node-stream/busboy internals whose behaviour under httpServerHandler's
// Node-request adaptation isn't something Cloudflare documents as supported
// (their own file-upload examples always use request.formData(), never
// multer). The interception happens before Express ever sees the request,
// so this router only ever handles GET here.
