/**
 * Deleting the customer data a delivery needed (MART_INTEGRATION.md §5).
 *
 * Per order, PartTime receives a display name, a contact number, a drop-off
 * address with coordinates, and delivery instructions. That is the whole list,
 * and the commitment made about it is precise:
 *
 *   - **Deleted seven days** after the order reaches a terminal state.
 *   - **Deleted means `DELETE`** - not a flag, not a filtered query. Data still
 *     in the database is still a liability.
 *   - **The purge is auditable and its failure visible.** A purge run is a
 *     recorded row, so a job that silently did not run is distinguishable from
 *     one that ran and found nothing.
 *
 * The third point is why this writes an audit row even when it changes nothing.
 * A promise to delete that nobody can prove was kept is not much of a promise,
 * and "no rows purged" and "the purge has not run since Tuesday" look identical
 * from the outside unless the quiet runs leave a trace too.
 *
 * THE ORDER ITSELF IS NOT DELETED. What is owed, to which store, on which
 * order, is a financial record and outlives the customer's details by design.
 * After a purge a Delivery row still says an order was placed at a shop, what it
 * was worth and who carried it - and no longer says who it went to.
