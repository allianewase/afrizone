/**
 * Talking back to AfriZoneMart (MART_INTEGRATION.md §4, §5).
 *
 * Two things go the other way, and they are different in kind:
 *
 *   REPORTS are facts. "A courier picked this up." PartTime never asks
 *   permission and never waits for an answer - §4 is explicit that these are
 *   events, not requests. A report that fails to send must not undo the thing
 *   it was reporting, which is why every call here is fire-and-forget and
 *   returns whether it landed rather than throwing.
 *
 *   THE OTP CHECK is a question, and the only one PartTime asks. Mart generates
 *   the customer's code, delivers it, and verifies it; PartTime never stores it
 *   and never sees it except in transit. That removes the hardest data problem
 *   in delivery outright - a code belonging to somebody with no PartTime
 *   account, when PartTime's own OtpCode model is keyed to a user.
 *
 * ENV-GATED, the same way the CAC lookup and Smile Identity are. Unconfigured,
 * reports are skipped and the OTP check answers UNAVAILABLE - which the caller
 * must surface as "we cannot check this right now", never as a wrong code. A
 * courier told their customer typed it wrong, when in fact nothing was asked,
 * will argue with the customer on the doorstep.
 *
 * SEPARATE SECRET FROM THE INBOUND ONE. §2: one shared secret means a leak
 * either side compromises both directions.

/**
 * How long either call waits before giving up.
 *
 * There is no default timeout on fetch, and both callers are people waiting:
 * a shopkeeper tapping "accept" and a courier standing at a door with a
 * customer in front of them. An unbounded wait turns a slow dependency into an
 * app that appears frozen, which is worse than an honest "could not check".
