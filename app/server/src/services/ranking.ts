/**
 * Who gets a delivery first (Blueprint §11).
 *
 * Until this existed, an order went on the board to every qualified courier
 * inside a circle that widened with time, and the first to tap took it. That is
 * fair to couriers and blind to the customer: the rider two streets away with
 * nothing on and a clean record lost to whoever happened to be looking at their
 * phone. Now, before the circle opens, the order goes to the best-placed online
 * couriers one at a time, each with a short window to themselves.
 *
 * THE GATE IS STILL THE GATE. Ranking only ever orders couriers who already
 * pass services/eligibility.ts. Skill, tier and credentials decide who MAY do
 * the job; this decides who is asked first among them. A courier who scores well
 * and lacks a licence is not on the list at all.
 *
 * THE LIST IS FROZEN WHEN THE ORDER GOES UP. Re-ranking on every read would let
 * a courier's turn vanish mid-window because somebody else came online, which is
 * a worse experience than a slightly stale list, and it would make "whose turn
 * is it?" depend on when you asked. Whose turn it is stays arithmetic on
 * `offeredAt` - see offerStateAt in deliveryOffer.ts - so there is no queue and
 * nothing that can stop advancing. The one stored thing is how many candidates
 * have been told, because a notification is an event, and the per-minute cron
 * needs to know not to send it twice.
 *
 * NOBODY ONLINE IS NOT A FAILURE. An empty list means no ranked phase, and the
 * order goes straight to the open circle exactly as it did before. Ranking can
 * only ever add a few minutes in front of the old behaviour, never take it away.
