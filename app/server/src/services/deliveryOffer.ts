/**
 * Who a delivery is offered to, and what happens when nobody takes it
 * (MART_INTEGRATION.md §6 D4).
 *
 * D4 was open until now. The answer taken: offer to couriers near the shop
 * first, widen the circle on a timer, and once it has waited long enough raise
 * it on the operations board for a person. No automatic fee increase - that is
 * a pricing decision with real cost exposure, it belongs to Blueprint §10 surge
 * pay, and none of that is built.
 *
 * THE RADIUS IS A PROPERTY OF THE POSTING, NOT A QUERY OVER COURIERS, and that
 * is the load-bearing decision in this file. PartTime stores no courier
 * location: `User.location` is free text and `CourierProfile` holds a vehicle
 * and a plate. There is nothing to run a "who is nearest" query against, and
 * inventing one would mean collecting and retaining live positions for every
 * rider - a standing privacy liability, a §5-shaped retention problem, and a
 * mobile release, all to answer a question that can be answered without any of
 * it. So the posting carries a circle that grows with time, and a courier
 * asking what they can claim says where they are in that request. The position
 * is used to answer and never written down.
 *
 * That also matches how this codebase already works: routes/clock.ts takes the
 * device's coordinates per request for the geofence, and routes/organizations.ts
 * measures the store map from a point supplied per request. This is the third
 * use of the same shape rather than a new one.
 *
 * RANKING IS THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS OPT-IN. Asking the best-placed
 * courier first (services/ranking.ts) needs to know who is near before anybody
 * asks, and nothing per-request can answer that. So a courier who taps "Go
 * online" leaves one point in CourierPresence, overwritten by each heartbeat and
 * deleted when they go offline or go quiet. The circle below still reads only
 * the position sent with the request; the stored one is used to rank and for
 * nothing else.
 *
 * EVERYTHING HERE IS DERIVED AT READ TIME. There is no timer and no queue -
 * including for the ranked phase: whose turn it is is the same arithmetic. The
 * per-minute cron only SENDS the "it is your turn" push; if it stopped, turns
 * would still pass on time, just silently. The radius at any moment is arithmetic on how long the order has
 * been waiting, which means it cannot drift, cannot be stale, and cannot stop
 * firing - the failure mode the delivery purge needs an audit row to make
 * visible does not exist for this. It is the same reason expired postings and
 * lapsed credentials are computed rather than swept.
