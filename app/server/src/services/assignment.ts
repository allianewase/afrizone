/**
 * The one place a worker becomes the person doing a task.
 *
 * routes/applications.ts used to carry this inline, with a comment saying the
 * delivery status move was "hung off approval rather than duplicated into a
 * delivery-specific claim route: there is one way work is assigned on this
 * platform, and a second one would eventually disagree with this one about who
 * holds a job." That was right, and self-claim is exactly the change that would
 * have broken it. So the body moved here instead of being copied: a courier
 * claiming an order and an admin approving an application now run the same
 * code, and the sentence stays true.
 *
 * Assigning is six things that must all happen or none of them usefully do:
 * the eligibility re-check, the APPROVED application with its frozen snapshot,
 * the slot, the contract, the ring-fenced pay, and - for a delivery - the order
 * moving to COURIER_ASSIGNED so the store and AfriZoneMart both stop waiting.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ATOMIC. These are separate writes against D1, not one
 * transaction, and the ordering is chosen so that every partial failure leaves a
 * state a person can finish rather than one they must unpick. The application is
 * APPROVED first because it is what requireAssignedTask() reads, so a worker
 * whose contract write failed can still be given one by hand and everything
 * downstream works. The delivery move is last and never fatal, because a courier
 * holding a signed contract for an order the board says nobody took is
 * recoverable, and refusing the whole assignment over a status field is not.
