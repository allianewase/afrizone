/**
 * One Mart order, from confirmed to delivered (MART_INTEGRATION.md §3.1, §4).
 *
 * `order.confirmed` has been answered 202 DEFERRED since the event bus shipped,
 * because there was no assignment path, no pickup and drop-off, and no way to
 * prove a customer got their goods. This is the first two. The third - the
 * customer OTP - is Mart's to generate and verify; see services/martOutbound.ts.
 *
 * THE STATUS AXIS HERE IS THE ORDER'S, NOT THE COURIER'S. `Contract.status`
 * already tracks one person's engagement with one posting, and it is the right
 * place for "in progress" and "paid". What it cannot hold is "the store has not
 * accepted this yet", a state that exists before any courier does and that can
 * end the order without one. Those need different people to act on them, and
 * collapsing them makes "did the rider fail, or did the store refuse?"
 * unanswerable.
 *
 * PREPARED IS A TIMESTAMP, NOT A STATE, for the same reason `Contract.signedAt`
 * is: whether the store has finished packing and how far the order has got are
 * two different questions, and a courier may well accept the job while the
 * shopkeeper is still bagging it. Making it a state forces an order through a
 * sequence that real shops do not respect.
