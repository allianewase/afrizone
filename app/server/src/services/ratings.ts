/**
 * Two-way ratings (Blueprint §9), and what happens once both sides have spoken.
 *
 * One rule runs through this file and it is the easy one to get wrong:
 *
 *   `Rating.workerId` is the worker in the engagement in BOTH directions. They
 *   are the subject when the direction is OF_WORKER and the author when it is
 *   OF_EXPERIENCE. So "ratings where workerId = X" now returns ratings of X AND
 *   ratings written by X, and any average taken over that set is wrong.
 *
 * `User.rating` is the number that matters here: it is shown on a profile and
 * used to rank people for work. recomputeWorkerRating() below is the only thing
 * that should ever write it, and it filters on direction for exactly that
 * reason.
