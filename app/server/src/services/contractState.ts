/**
 * The work lifecycle: one Tasker's engagement with one Task, start to finish.
 *
 * Blueprint §4.2 lists eleven states and asks for them to be modelled explicitly
 * "so payment, disputes and analytics all hang off clean transitions". This is
 * that model.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES ON Contract AND NOT ON Task, which is the one structural
 * decision worth understanding before changing anything here:
 *
 *   §4.2 describes two lifecycles as though they were one. "Published" and
 *   "Expired (unclaimed)" are facts about the POSTING. "Claimed", "In Progress",
 *   "Submitted" and "Paid" are facts about ONE PERSON doing the work. A task
 *   with five slots has one posting and five engagements, and they move
 *   independently - three people can be In Progress while a fourth is already
 *   Paid and the posting itself is still Published.
 *
 *   Blueprint §12 already resolves this: Contract "binds Task to Tasker". So the
 *   posting keeps Task.status and the work lives here, one row per person per
 *   task. Putting all eleven on Task would force slots to be 1 forever.
 *
 * EXPIRED IS NOT IN THIS ENUM, deliberately. A posting that nobody claimed
 * before its deadline is expired by the passage of time, not by anything anyone
 * did - so it is derived at read time from `deadline`, exactly as credential
 * expiry is derived rather than stored (see ARCHITECTURE.md §12). A stored
 * EXPIRED needs a scheduled job, and a job that fails to run leaves a dead task
 * looking live. There is now exactly one cron in this codebase - the delivery
 * customer-data purge, which exists because absence of data cannot be derived -
 * and this is still not a second reason to have one.
