/**
 * Courier onboarding (Blueprint §3.2, §15).
 *
 * A courier is a Tasker with a vehicle. Everything that makes them employable -
 * a verified identity, a licence, papers, insurance - already has machinery:
 * KYC, `Credential`, and the eligibility engine. What was missing was the
 * vehicle itself and, more importantly, a way for a rider to see how far along
 * they are.
 *
 * READINESS IS NOT ELIGIBILITY, and conflating them would be a mistake worth
 * naming. `services/eligibility.ts` answers "can this person take THIS task",
 * against that task's own requirements, and it is the only thing that may refuse
 * work. This answers "is this person set up to be offered delivery work at all",
 * which is an onboarding checklist. A courier who is fully ready here can still
 * be turned down for a particular delivery, and that is correct.
 *
 * Nothing in this file gates anything. It is a progress report.
