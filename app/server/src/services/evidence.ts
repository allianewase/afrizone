/**
 * Proof of work: photos with where and when (Blueprint §14).
 *
 * Until this existed, finishing a job was the worker saying so. A timesheet was
 * submitted, a delivery marked collected, an audit score typed in, and a person
 * at Afrizone either believed it or phoned somebody. Now each of those moments
 * needs a photo taken there and then, and the photo arrives with its position
 * and time - so most of what that phone call would have established is checked
 * the moment it lands.
 *
 * MISSING EVIDENCE REFUSES; DOUBTFUL EVIDENCE FLAGS. The gate is only "is there
 * a photo for this step at all". Whether the photo is convincing - taken at the
 * site, recently, with a decent fix - is written down as flags for a reviewer
 * and never blocks anybody: GPS drifts by a street indoors, phones keep the
 * wrong time, and a courier standing at the right door must not be stopped by
 * either. Blocking on a check that is wrong one time in twenty would teach
 * people to work around it.
 *
 * WHAT EACH KIND OF WORK NEEDS is the table below, and only that table. Every
 * gate asks `required(task, stage)` rather than knowing the rules itself, so a
 * change of policy is one edit.
