// dev` exactly as they do to `wrangler deploy` - so a local API run straight
// from a clean checkout is configured with the PRODUCTION origins, and every
// localhost origin is refused. Both browser clients (web-admin on 5173, the
// Expo web preview on 8081) fail against their own local backend, while the
// code here reads as though localhost were covered. Local development
// therefore needs CORS_ORIGIN set in app/server/.env, which is gitignored;
// .env.example carries the line to uncomment.
//
// Resolved lazily inside the origin callback, not at module scope: Workers
// only populate process.env from bindings once request handling begins, not
// at pure module-evaluation time - reading CORS_ORIGIN eagerly here always
// saw it as unset, permanently locking CORS to the localhost-only fallback
// regardless of what's actually configured for production. See

// The NODE_ENV check is made INSIDE each request handler below, not by
// conditionally registering the middleware at module scope: Workers only
// populate process.env from bindings once request handling begins, not at
// pure module-evaluation time, so a module-scope `if (NODE_ENV !== "test")`

// NOTE: express-rate-limit's default in-memory store is per-isolate. Workers
// can run many concurrent isolates, so this is a best-effort per-isolate
// backstop against abuse/scraping now, not a strict global rate limit the
// way it was on a single long-lived Railway process. Accepted trade-off for
// this migration; moving to Cloudflare's native rate-limiting rules or a
// Durable-Object-backed counter is a real follow-up, not done here.
//
// The limiters are also constructed lazily, not at module scope: MemoryStore
// calls setInterval() the moment rateLimit() runs, and Workers hard-forbid
// timers (and any async I/O or randomness) outside of a request handler -
// "Disallowed operation called within global scope." Deferring construction
// to the first real request keeps that setInterval call inside a valid
// request context instead of module-evaluation time.
//
// keyGenerator is also overridden: express-rate-limit's default reads
// req.ip, which httpServerHandler's Node-request adaptation leaves
// undefined (there's no real TCP socket behind a Workers request the way
// there is on a normal Node HTTP server) - throws ERR_ERL_UNDEFINED_IP_ADDRESS
// otherwise. Cloudflare's edge always sets CF-Connecting-IP on real traffic;
// falling back to a constant key in local dev (where that header is absent)
// just means dev testing shares one bucket, which is fine.
// The "local-dev" fallback is only ever correct off-edge. If CF-Connecting-IP
// were ever missing on real traffic, EVERY user would collapse into a single
// shared bucket and rate-limit each other out of the whole API - so make that
