/**
 * "How are you using Afrizone Part Time?" - the front door.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CHOICE DOES AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IT DOES NOT:
 *
 *   It picks the sign-up FLOW. Individuals sign up with a phone number and an
 *   OTP, which is how the platform has always onboarded workers; stores and
 *   couriers sign up with an email and a password, like every other credentialed
 *   account. So the answer here genuinely changes the next screen.
 *
 *   It does NOT decide which dashboard anyone lands on. That comes from the
 *   account type stored on the server, read after sign-in (see app/_layout.tsx).
 *   Someone who taps the wrong card here is not stranded and is not told off -
 *   they simply arrive where their account actually belongs. A front-door
 *   question that can lock a person out of their own account would be worse
 *   than no question at all.
 *
 * Which is also why signing in skips this screen entirely. You do not have to
 * declare what you are in order to log in; the server already knows.
 *
 * Restyled to afrizone-onboarding-screens.html's screen 02: select-then-
 * "Continue" (was tap-a-card-and-go-immediately) - the mock's own
 * interaction model, still routing the same way once confirmed.
