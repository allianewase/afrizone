/**
 * Account-type copy and routing, in one place.
 *
 * Two rules live here rather than being spread across the screens that need
 * them, because both are easy to get subtly wrong in one spot and not notice:
 *
 *   readAccountType() never returns undefined. A screen reached by deep link,
 *   a back-navigation, or a param that arrived as an array must still know what
 *   kind of account is being created. Falling back to INDIVIDUAL is safe in a
 *   way the alternatives are not: it is the least-privileged of the three, and
 *   the server validates the value again anyway.
 *
 *   homeRouteFor() is the ONLY place that decides which dashboard someone lands
 *   on, and it reads the type the SERVER returned - never the one tapped at the
 *   front door. Someone who chose the wrong card is not stranded; they simply
 *   arrive where their account actually belongs.
