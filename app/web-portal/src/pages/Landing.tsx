/**
 * The front door of the Part-Time portal.
 *
 * It used to be a bare account-type picker: a question, three cards, done. That
 * is the right shape for somebody who already knows what Afrizone Part Time is
 * and has been sent here to sign up. It is the wrong shape for the larger group
 * — a shop owner who followed a link, or a rider who heard about it from
 * another rider — because it asks them to commit before it has said what they
 * would be committing to.
 *
 * So the picker is still the centre of the page, and everything around it
 * exists to answer the questions somebody asks before they are willing to use
 * it: what is this, what happens after I sign up, what do I get, and what will
 * it cost me. Modelled on suppliers.afrizonemart.com, which does the same job
 * for the supply side of the business.
 *
 * NOTHING ON THIS PAGE PROMISES SOMETHING THE PLATFORM DOES NOT DO. Every claim
 * below is a feature that exists in the build today — the eligibility gate,
 * credential verification, the escrow commitment, the delivery code, WHT on
 * payouts. Marketing copy that runs ahead of the product is how a store's first
 * week becomes a support ticket.
 *
 * WHAT THE CHOICE DOES NOT DO: it does not decide which dashboard anybody lands
 * on. That comes from the account type stored on the server (see lib/auth.tsx).
 * Someone who picks the wrong card and then signs in arrives where their account
 * actually belongs, with no correction and no dead end.

            THE ADMIN ADDRESS IS NOT PUBLISHED HERE, AND MUST NOT BE ADDED BACK.
            This line used to link to the staff console by name and URL, which
            handed every visitor — and every crawler and scanner — the address
            of the one application on the platform that can approve payouts and
            read customer data. Staff already know where they work; nobody else
            needs to.

            The sentence stays, because its job was never the link: somebody
            from Afrizone who lands here has to be told this is not their
            sign-in, or they file a ticket about a password that was never going
            to work.
