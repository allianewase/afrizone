/**
 * The real AfriZoneMart mark — the orange continent with the cart inside it.
 *
 * The portal had been showing a navy tile with the letter "A" in it, which was
 * a placeholder that outlived its welcome. Stores and couriers sign in here and
 * hand their business to whatever is on the screen; a stand-in glyph is the
 * wrong first impression for the one surface outsiders actually see.
 *
 * SAME FILES AS EVERYWHERE ELSE, deliberately. These are copied byte-for-byte
 * from `web-admin/public/`, and mobile ships the same artwork. All of them must
 * change together — a portal whose logo has drifted from the console's is worse
 * than one with no logo at all, because it reads as a different company.
 *
 * THE srcSet LADDER IS NOT DECORATION. The artwork is 107x113. Asking a browser
 * to reduce that straight to 30px is a 3.5x downscale and it reads muddy — the
 * cart's outline breaks up. The 76 and 92 variants are resampled in linear
 * light with premultiplied alpha, which browsers do not do, so the browser only
 * ever has to halve a file or use it 1:1 on a 2x screen.

 * the name is selectable and readable to a screen reader without alt-text
 * duplication — which is why the mark itself is `aria-hidden` and the label
 * lives on the wrapper.
